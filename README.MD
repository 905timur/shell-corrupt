## Secure File Corruption Script

This script implements a secure file corruption method by first encrypting the target files using AES encryption and then overwriting them with pseudo-random data. This ensures that even with the overwritten data, the original file content remains protected and unreadable without the decryption key.

**Key Functions:**

* **`GenerateRandomData`:** Generates a specified amount of random data using a cryptographically secure random number generator (RNG).
* **`EncryptFile`:** Encrypts the file content using AES encryption with a 256-bit key (128-bit in this case) and an initialization vector (IV). 

**Corruption Process:**

1. Select a specified number of random files within the target directory.
2. **Encrypt:** Encrypt each selected file using the `EncryptFile` function.
3. **Overwrite:** Overwrite the encrypted file content with pseudo-random data generated by `GenerateRandomData`. 

**Configuration:**

* `$targetDirectory`: Path to the directory containing the files to be corrupted.
* `$numFilesToCorrupt`: Number of files to corrupt (default: 5000).
* `$fileSize`: Target size for each corrupted file (default: 1MB).
* `$chunkSize`: Size of each data chunk written to the file (default: 1KB).

**Considerations:**

* **Security:**
    * **Encryption Key:** The encryption key must be securely stored and protected.
    * **IV:** Use a random IV for each file for enhanced security. Consider storing the IV securely alongside the key.
* **Performance:**
    * Sequential processing can be slow for large numbers of files. Consider multi-threading for improved performance.
* **File System:** Be mindful of the `$fileSize` parameter. Overwriting with data exceeding the original file size may cause issues.

**Potential Enhancements:**

* **Dynamic IV Generation:** Implement random IV generation for each file.
* **Multi-threading:** Utilize multi-threading for concurrent file processing.
* **Secure Key Management:** Integrate with a secure key management service (e.g., Azure Key Vault).
